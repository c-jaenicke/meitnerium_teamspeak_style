## Icon Pack

Maybe i will create an icon pack myself, idk yet.

In the screenshots i use the [DarkenTS Icon Pack](https://www.myteamspeak.com/addons/0b57d54d-b46c-433d-8f7e-2eea28470007)

Any icon pack that is bright should work.

## Installation

I would love to upload this to the offical addon store, but to my knowledge Teamspeak does not allow new upload at this time.

So you have to install these styles manually.

### Windows

1. Go into your ```AppData``` folder, press ```WIN + R``` and enter ```%appdata%```
2. Open the ```TS3Client``` folder
3. Open the ```styles``` folder
4. Copy the skin you want into this folder

E.g. if you want ```MeitneriumBlue``` copy all files in the MeitneriumBlue folder into there.

### Linux

*todo*

## Report any errors or mistakes i made

There may be some inconsistencies in this skin. Maybe some borders are not the same color or i missed something.
There are also some red elements, please report those, as i may have missed them or didnt know what they did, to find them better i made them red.

Thank you
